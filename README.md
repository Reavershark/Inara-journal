# Inara-journal

Bash script for easier Elite:Dangerous journal uploading to Inara.

Running the script with `./journal.sh` combines Elite:Dangerous game logs from the last 25 days in a single Journal.log file, ready for uploading to https://inara.cz.

Note: not needed anymore since frontier finally has an API for this.
